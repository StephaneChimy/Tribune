                        Here is a time line of Linus life.
                    </h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>December 1969</strong>, Born in Helsinki</li>
                        <li><strong>1981</strong>, His interest in computers began</li>
                        <li><strong>1988</strong>, Torvalds attended the University of Helsinki</li>
                        <li><strong>5 January 1991</strong>, begin the work on Linux</li>
                        <li><strong>14 March 1994</strong>, Linux: Version 1.0 was released</li>
                        <li><strong>1996</strong>, Torvalds accepted a position at the company in California, where he would work from February 1997 until June 2003. He then moved to the Open Source Development Labs, which has since merged with the Free Standards Group to become the Linux Foundation</li>
                        <li><strong>From 1997 to 1999</strong>, he was involved in 86open helping to choose the standard binary format for Linux and Unix.</li>
                        <li><strong>1999</strong>, he was named by the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the world's top 100 innovators under age 35. Although Torvalds believes "open source is the only right way to do software", he also has said that he uses the "best tool for the job", even if that includes proprietary software. He was criticized for his use and alleged advocacy of the proprietary BitKeeper software for version control in the Linux kernel. Torvalds subsequently wrote a free-software replacement for BitKeeper called Git.</li>
                        <li><strong>2008</strong>, Torvalds stated that he used the Fedora distribution of Linux because it had fairly good support for the PowerPC processor architecture, which he had favored at the time.</li>
                        <li><strong>16 September 2018</strong> the Linux Kernel Code of Conflict was suddenly replaced by a new Code of Conduct based on the Contributor Covenant. Shortly thereafter, in the release notes for Linux 4.19-rc4, Linus apologized for his behavior, calling the personal attacks of the past "unprofessional and uncalled for" and announced a period of "time off" to "get some assistance on how to understand people's emotions and respond appropriately".</li>
                    </ul>
